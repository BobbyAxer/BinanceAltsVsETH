# BinanceAltsVsETH

I downloaded data from all the coins on Binance and tried to figure out how they perform against Ether - whether the altcoin portfolio beats Ether. 
The data is not sufficient to draw an accurate conclusion, but some useful information can be taken from this code. 
I also made a plot of how other sectors perform against Ether (it's interesting that there is no growth for more than two months).
